## Idea

I always have my terminal open, I also like to have all my tools in one place.

I needed a way to track my transaction with my friend and family and I thought "_why not_".

## Usage

Use `mt` as prefix to any command.

Asking to show all the transaction (including resolved ones):  

- `mt --list --showResolved`
